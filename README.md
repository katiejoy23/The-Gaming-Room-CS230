Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Their Software Requirements:
The Gaming Room is the client, a company looking to expand its existing mobile game 
Draw It or Lose It into a web-based platform accessible on multiple operating systems and devices. 
Their main requirements include supporting multiple teams and players with unique identifiers, 
ensuring the game runs as a single instance in memory, and addressing name uniqueness to prevent conflicts. 
The key challenges involved scalability, cross-platform compatibility, efficient resource management, 
and ensuring robust security for user data.

What I Did Well in Developing the Documentation:
One of the strengths in developing the documentation was the clear articulation of design constraints 
and requirements, particularly in outlining how the Singleton and Iterator design patterns were employed 
to manage the game instance and player collections. I effectively conveyed technical details in a way that 
aligned with the project goals and demonstrated a strong understanding of system architecture, 
design patterns, and resource management techniques.

Helpful Aspects of the Design Document Process:
The design document provided a structured approach to understanding and addressing the project’s scope 
before diving into the coding process. This was especially useful for identifying potential issues early, 
such as how to handle concurrency and unique identifiers. It also helped me break down the design into manageable 
components, allowing for a more thoughtful and organized development process.

One Part of the Work to Revise:
If I could revise one part of my work, I would enhance the evaluation section that compares different 
operating platforms. While the section addresses the key requirements, I would add more detailed performance 
benchmarks and compatibility testing insights to offer a more in-depth comparison. Improving the depth of this 
analysis would better inform the client's decision on which platform is best suited for the game’s expansion.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs in Software Design:
To interpret the user’s needs, I considered the main goals—scalability, ease of access across platforms, 
and the need for efficient management of game states and teams. By breaking down the client’s requirements 
and prioritizing elements like system architecture, security, and memory management, I was able to design 
a solution that met their objectives. Understanding user needs is vital because it ensures that the software 
will solve the actual problems the client faces, improving usability, performance, and long-term satisfaction.

Approach to Designing Software and Future Strategies:
In approaching the design, I started by outlining the core features, constraints, and requirements from the client, 
then applied proven software design patterns and techniques like Singleton, Iterator, and client-server architecture 
to ensure scalability and efficiency. Going forward, I would further incorporate user feedback throughout the 
development process and employ agile methodologies to iteratively refine the software. I would also prioritize creating 
comprehensive test plans earlier in the design phase to ensure the system’s robustness under different conditions.
